In its third year, the NeurIPS 2025 Creative AI track invites research papers and artworks that explore cutting-edge applications of artificial intelligence and machine learning in art, design, and creative practice.

Focused on the theme of Humanity, this year’s track asks: _what does it mean to be human when we share an increasingly symbiotic relationship with machines that imitate, create, hallucinate, and persuade?_ We welcome submissions from artists, designers, creatives, researchers, and critical thinkers that question and explore:

- How do machines and humans collaborate by playing to their unique strengths?
- What emotional, cultural, or ethical wisdom must we protect or reconsider?
- What new human rituals, responsibilities, or roles will emerge in the new age of AI?
- How do we navigate creativity and agency when authorship is shared and continuously evolving with non‑human entities?
- How does human craft and labor evolve alongside those of machines? And how do we value and reward human skills and creativity while strengthening our social and cultural fabric?
- How will differences in energy consumption between humans and AI impact the way we conceptualise sustainability and choose what is good for the planet in the longer term?
- What principles and values do we imbue in artificial intelligence systems? What are the perils of anthropomorphizing non‑human systems?

Submissions are **not** exclusively limited to the themes above, and we are open to all forms of artwork and research papers that propose original ideas in Creative AI. We particularly encourage work that crosses disciplinary boundaries, and is critical, speculative, poetic, performative, or empirical. This flexibility of formats and the on‑site gathering at NeurIPS will provide a forum for a diversity of voices and lead to engaging discussions that will benefit our community.

We invite submissions in all areas of creativity including visual art, music, performing art, film, design, architecture, and more in the format of video recording. 

NeurIPS is a prestigious AI/ML conference that tens of thousands of researchers from academia and industry attend every year. Selected works at the Creative AI track will be presented on large display screens at the conference and the authors will have the opportunity to interact with the NeurIPS research community to germinate more collaborative ideas.
